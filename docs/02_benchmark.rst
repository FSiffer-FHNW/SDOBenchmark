Open Points
===========
Various points are still open due to time constraints.

Implementation
--------------
- The benchmark has to be implemented. One possibility is to use two CSV files
  as an input (one for the ground truth, one for the model predictions).
  Each CSV file contains two columns: the sample id and its peak flux.
