    "My personal entry for the SDOBenchmark consists of a model trained on a categorization of the label *peak_flux*. This model performs predictions with a **True Skill Statistic** of **0.45** and a converted **Mean Absolute Error** of **3.6e-5**. In other words, it is better than random or constant predictions, but is far from any reliable prediction.\n",
