    <h2 class="alt"><strong>SDOBenchmark</strong> is a machine learning image dataset for the prediction of solar flares.</h2>
    <p>Solar flares are intense bursts of radiation which can disrupt the power grids of a continent, shut down the GPS system or
    irradiate people exposed in space.<br />
    Developing systems for predicting solar flares would allow us to precisely aim our 
    observation instruments at upcoming events, and eventually enable countermeasures against such worst-case scenarios.</p>
