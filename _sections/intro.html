    <h2 class="alt"><strong>SDOBenchmark</strong> is a machine learning image dataset for the prediction of solar flares.</h2>
    <p>Solar flare eruptions can reach scales whose emissions blow out the electric grids of a continent, shut down the GPS system or
    contaminate people in space with life-threatening X-rays. <br />
    Developing predictions for solar flares would allow us to precisely align our
    research sensors for all upcoming events, and eventually enable countermeasures against such worst case scenarios.</p>
