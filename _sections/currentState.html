    There exist several active forecasts for solar activity. A nonextensive list of examples are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The 24h prediction of solar monitor at <a href="https://solarmonitor.org/forecast.php">solarmonitor.org</a></li>
    <li>The manual forecasts of the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (e.g. <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/3-day-forecast">here</a> or <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/weekly-highlights-and-27-day-forecast"></a>)</li>
    <li><a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa789b/meta">A RandomForest applied on HMI data</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02422.pdf">Arxiv</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Besides the mentioned predictions, plenty of research about solar activities are being conducted.<br />
    To our knowledge, noone has applied CNNs on AIA and HMI image products for flare prediction.
