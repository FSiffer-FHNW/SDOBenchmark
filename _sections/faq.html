            <div class="5u 12u$(mobile)">
                In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgRFLmhSAW0">September 2017</a> a flare erupted of
                a magnitude larger than any other in the last decade. In the dataset, this flare is represented
                with a peak flux of 0.001 (i.e. 1e-3). The smallest flare that is part of the data is listed with
                a peak flux of 1e-7 (while 1e-9 is "nothing happens at all").

    <button class="accordion">Why are there so few training samples?</button>
    <div class="accordionpanel">
        <p>
            The easy answer is that we can't artificially produce or simulate more flares. But there is also
            a strategic choice behind it:<br />
            Imagine you have to train a network to recognize cats. We'd give you a training image set of 10 million
            images, recorded by our cameras around our neighbourhood. While 10 million images is a great size
            for deep learning, you'd soon come to realize that all our images are from the same 1'000 cats. As a
            consequence, your model would overfit horribly.<br />
            We therefore chose to preselect only a few of the most different images per cat.

    <button class="accordion">Why the mean absolute error as a metric?</button>
    <div class="accordionpanel">
        <p>
            Due to the logarithmic nature of the label <i>peak_flux</i>, the mean absolute error weighs errors with strong activities
            much higher than in calm or low activities. While this correlates with our intentions, the data imbalance
            helps to rebalance the otherwise predominant strong flare predictions to some degree.<br />
            Further, while there are plenty of norms around, the mean absolute error is simple and exists out of the box in practically
            all machine learning frameworks.

    <button class="accordion">Why did you create this dataset?</button>
    <div class="accordionpanel">
        <p>
            Creating a solar flare prediction dataset requires a lot of domain knowledge and time. By providing an already
            existing dataset we hope to encourage machine learners to push the envelope of solar flare predictions. We therefore
            put a lot of effort into providing both great accessibility and high scientific quality.

    <button class="accordion">Where can I contact someone for questions or discussions?</button>
    <div class="accordionpanel">
        <p>
            On the <a href="https://github.com/i4Ds/SDOBenchmark/issues">SDOBenchmark GitHub issues page</a>.

    <button class="accordion">Why not predict more hours/more detail/on higher resolution?</button>
    <div class="accordionpanel">
        <p>
            Currently, it is still unknown how well models will perform on this dataset. We believe in the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS principle</a>, and while the prediction
            resolution might seem low, a well performing model on this data would still
            provide great value.<br />
            If models perform well, we will gladly provide a more difficult prediction problem.
