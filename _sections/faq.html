        <ul>
            <li>SDO is the mission and the satellite which is orbiting around earth</li>
            <li>AIA and HMI are two detectors ("cameras") that record what happens on the sun</li>

    <div class="accordionpanel">
        <ul>
            <li>A single sample is a collection of images over four time steps (Convolutions and RNNs)</li>

    <button class="accordion">What is a large flare, what is not?</button>

                In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgRFLmhSAW0">September 2017</a> a flare erupted of
                a magnitude larger than any other in the last decade. In the dataset, this flare is represented
                with a peak flux of 0.001 (i.e. 1e-3). The smallest flare that is part of the data is listed with
                a peak flux of 1e-7 (while 1e-9 is "nothing happens at all").

    <button class="accordion">Why are there so few training samples?</button>
    <div class="accordionpanel">
        <p>
            The easy answer is that we can't artificially produce or simulate more flares. But there is also
            a strategic choice behind it:<br />
            Imagine you have to train a network to recognize cats. We'd give you a training image set of 10 million
            images, recorded by our cameras around our neighbourhood. While 10 million images is a great size
            for deep learning, you'd soon come to realize that all our images are from the same 1'000 cats. As a
            consequence, your model would overfit horribly.<br />
            We therefore chose to preselect only a few images per cat, but each as different to the others as possible.
